# autovalidate-angularJS-form
A contact form in AngularJS with a great user experience.

#Overview
While learning to program in AngularJS I found dealing with forms a great challenge. I hope with this demo app you will not go through the same experience that I had.

#Instructions:
1. Simply download the zip file or clone the repo, 
2. Open index.html on your favorite editor. 
3. Use cdn to add the necessary dependencies or download them from relevant sites, and you are good to go! (will add them soon for you)

#Live Demo
I have hosted the project on my server, here you can actually see the demo in action:
